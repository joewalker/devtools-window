/**
 * A Target represents something that we can debug. Targets are generally
 * read-only. Any changes that you wish to make to a target should be done via
 * a Tool that attaches to the target. i.e. a Target is just a pointer saying
 * "the thing to debug is over there".
 *
 * Providing a generalized abstraction of a web-page or web-browser (available
 * either locally or remotely) is beyond the scope of this class (and maybe
 * also beyond the scope of this universe) However Target does attempt to
 * abstract some common events and read-only properties common to many Tools.
 *
 * Supported read-only properties:
 * - name, isRemote, url
 *
 * Target extends EventEmitter and provides support for the following events:
 * - close: The target window has been closed. All tools attached to this
 *     target should close. This event is not currently cancelable.
 * - navigate: The target window has navigated to a different URL
 * - reload: The target window has been refreshed via F5 or a similar mechanism
 * - change: One of the read-only
 *
 * Target also supports 2 functions to help allow 2 different versions of
 * Firefox debug each other. The 'version' property is the equivalent of
 * browser detection - simple and easy to implement but gets fragile when things
 * are not quite what they seem. The 'supports' property is the equivalent of
 * feature detection - harder to setup, but more robust long-term.
 *
 * Comparing Targets: 2 instances of a Target object can point at the same
 * thing, so t1 !== t2 and t1 != t2 even when they represent the same object.
 * To compare to targets use 't1.equals(t2)'.
